                    <p>The Book of Mormon: The Book of Mormon is an ancient record of the original inhabitant of the
                    Americas published by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. It spans over a thousand
                    years of history that includes both personal accounts and the events of entire peoples.<br>
                    The primary purpose of the Book of Mormon is the testify of Jesus Christ. It is to serve as a
                    companion volume to the Bible and serves to clarify the teachings of ancient prophets.
                    The book was written by many ancient prophets by the spirit of prophecy and revelation. Their words, written on gold plates, were quoted and abridged by a prophet-historian named Mormon. The record gives an account of two great civilizations. One came from Jerusalem in 600 B.C. and afterward separated into two nations, known as the Nephites and the Lamanites. The other came much earlier when the Lord confounded the tongues at the Tower of Babel. This group is known as the Jaredites. After thousands of years, all were destroyed except the Lamanites, and they are among the ancestors of the American Indians.</p>
