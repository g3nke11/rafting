            <p>Pawn of Prophecy: The Pawn of Prophecy is a fantasy book written by David Eddings and published by Grim
                Oak Press. It is the first book in the Belgariad series, which contains a total of five main books with
                additional companion volumes.<br>
                Book Description from publisher: Long ago, so the Storyteller claimed, the evil god Torak sought
                dominion and drove men and gods to war. But Belgrath the Sorcerer led men to reclaim the Orb that
                protected the West. So long as it lay at Riva, the prophecy went, men would be safe. That was only a
                story, and Garion did not believe in magic dooms, even though the man without a shadow had haunted him
                for years. Brought up on a quiet farm by his Aunt Pol, how could he know that the Apostate planned to
                wake dread Torak, or that he would be led on a quest of unparalleled magic and danger by those he loved,
                but did not truly know.<br>
                For yet a little while, his dreams of innocence remained safe, untroubled by knowledge of his strange
                heritage. For a little while... thus begins The Belgariad, an epic fantasy of immense scope set against
                a history of 7,000 years. It tells of the struggles between ancient gods and mighty Kings, and of men in
                strange lands facing fated events, all bound by a prophecy that must be fulfilled.<br><br></p>

            <p>Fablehaven: Fablehaven is a fantasy book written by Brandon Mull and published by Simon and Schuster.
                Fablehaven is the first book in the five volume Fablehaven series.<br>
                Book Description from publisher: For centuries mystical creatures of all description were gathered into
                a hidden refuge called Fablehaven to prevent their extinction. The sanctuary survives today as one of
                the last strongholds of true magic. Enchanting? Absolutely. Exciting? You bet. Safe? Well, actually,
                quite the opposite.<br>
                Kendra and her brother, Seth, have no idea that their grandfather is the current caretaker of
                Fablehaven. Inside the gated woods, ancient laws keep relative order among greedy trolls, mischievous
                satyrs, plotting witches, spiteful imps, and jealous fairies. However, when the rules get broken—Seth is
                a bit too curious and reckless for his own good—powerful forces of evil are unleashed, and Kendra and
                her brother face the greatest challenge of their lives. To save their family, Fablehaven, and perhaps
                even the world, Kendra and Seth must find the courage to do what they fear most.</p>
            <img src="images/Book_Photos/rsz_thefellowshipofthering_harpercollins.jpg" alt="The Fellowship of the Ring"
                class="home_selection">
            <p>The Fellowship of the Ring: The Fellowship of the Ring was written by J.R.R. Tolkien and originally
                published by Allen & Unwin Book Publishers in 1954. This book is still a classic read along with the
                following two books in this three book series.<br>
                Book Description by publisher: One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them
                all and in darkness bind them.<br>
                In ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged
                the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken
                from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages it
                fell into the hands of Bilbo Baggins, as told in The Hobbit. In a sleepy village in the Shire, young
                Frodo Baggins finds himself faced with an immense task, as his elderly cousin Bilbo entrusts the Ring to
                his care. Frodo must leave his home and make a perilous journey across Middle-earth to the Cracks of
                Doom, there to destroy the Ring and foil the Dark Lord in his evil purpose.<br><br></p>
